# Node templates should have one of the following formats:
#   n00()                     - a node with no curie or category specified
#   n00(category)                 - a node with only a category of any kind specified
#   n00(category=biolink:Protein)         - a node with a specific category (such as a biolink:Protein) specified
#   n00(id)                - a node with a specific curie specified
#   n00(id,category=biolink:Protein)   - a node with a specific curie of the specified category.
# Edge templates should have the following format:
#   e00()                     - an edge with no specification
#
# NOTE: Node order should always start with the most specific node (e.g. curie)
# NOTE: The first node should always be n00 and increment from there. And the first edge e00.
#       In order that incoming QNodes are properly remapped, these templates need to follow this n00, e00, n01, ... convention

    name: One node with only a category
    description: A single node that has no curie but has a category. This could easily generate thousands of things.
    restated_question: Which n00(category)s are known?
    template:
      - n00(category)
    error: The input QueryGraph would just lead to thousands of nodes with this category. Not currently supported.

    name: One node with not even a category
    description: A single node that has no curie and no category. This is like tell me everything
    restated_question: Which biological entities are known?
    template:
      - n00()
    error: The input QueryGraph would yield all nodes in our knowledge graph. Not currently supported.
