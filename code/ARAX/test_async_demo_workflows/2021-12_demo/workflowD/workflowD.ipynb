    "blood work of a cancer patient revealed extreme high serum ferritin\n",
    "levels. This finding was not explained since iron metabolism parameters\n",
    "appeared normal. Hyperferritinemia is a condition known to be associated\n",
    "with systemic inflammation. However, it is less known but well\n",
    "documented that ferritin inhibits T-cell function, and the patient was\n",
    "about to obtain therapeutic T-cell infusion as immunotherapy. Therefore,\n",
    "clinicians looked into possibilities to lower ferritin levels. A\n",
    "pharmaceutical company helped by searching in its vast internal database\n",
    "of drug (side) effects on a variety of clinical and laboratory\n",
    "parameters ever observed in drug trials. The return suggested that\n",

    "The mechanism may be a multi-step molecular cascade. Multiple pathways\n",
    "exist in the literature.\n",
