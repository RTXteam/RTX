    "The difference between query_0_1 and query_0 is the reverse direction between the Gene and SmallMolecule. We found only a few results such as  <font color='blue'>RUXOLITINIB</font>. Evidence from the biothings-multiomics-biggim-drugresponse KP shows cell lines with RHOBTB2 mutations shows significant lower IC50 values compared to cell lines with wildtype RHOBTB2. RUXOLITINIB is JAK inhibitors. JAK-STAT3 signaling has been reported to cross-talk with Rho GTPase signaling in the context of cancer [PMC4125382]. The underline mechanism of the higher sensitivity of JAK inhibitor RUXOLITINIB in the RHOBTB2 mutated samples is still not clear. More knowledge graphs or multiple hop queries will be needed. </br> Edit by Guangrong Qin "
