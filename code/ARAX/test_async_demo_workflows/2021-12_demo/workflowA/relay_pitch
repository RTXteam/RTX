I'm going to tell you about a gene called RHOBTB2. Not only is this gene hard to say, it has overactive variants that cause epilepsy, learning difficulties, and movement disorders. Children born with one of these variants can possibly never learn to walk and have severe intellectual disabilities. Anyone worth their salt would try to treat this disorder by reducing the activity of these harmful, overactive variants. So all we have to do is find a drug that down regulates this gene. Right? But if we go to one of the many databases out there and search for this we find nothing. Again, it doesn't take much of a leap to ask what drug can affect a gene that in turn controls RHOBTB2. We have all of that information. We know what genes affect expression of RHOBTB2 and we know what drugs affect these genes. BUT there is no database where we can make that complete query - except Translator. Sure we can manually do all the smaller queries and manually take those results and do more manual queries - but how much time and energy would that take? As a clinician, I don't even know about all the databases that hold critical pieces of the puzzle I'm trying to put together. Meanwhile my patient is suffering! With Translator I can prepare a query, run the query, and have results to review in an hour. Not only that, but I can filter my answers to show only drugs that are already FDA approved that I can explore for off-label use or a clinical trial. Let's look at some examples. <show results - be sure to point out combination of data types and siloes - point out the resources that enable the answers> This query can be used for many other disease variants. This is just the beginning of what Translator has to offer. Let's look at some more complicated queries.
