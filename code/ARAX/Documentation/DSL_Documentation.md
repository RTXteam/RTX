# Domain Specific Langauage (DSL) description
This document describes the features and components of the DSL developed for the ARA Expander team.

Full documentation is given below, but an example can help: in the API specification, there is field called `Query.previous_message_processing_plan.processing_actions:`,
while initially an empty list, a set of processing actions can be applied with something along the lines of:

```
[
"add_qnode(name=hypertension, key=n00)",  # add a new node to the query graph
"add_qnode(category=biolink:Protein, is_set=True, key=n01)",  # add a new set of nodes of a certain type to the query graph
"add_qedge(subject=n01, object=n00, key=e00)",  # add an edge connecting these two nodes
"expand(edge_key=e00)",  # reach out to knowledge providers to find all subgraphs that satisfy these new query nodes/edges
"overlay(action=compute_ngd)",  # overlay each edge with the normalized Google distance (a metric based on Edge.subject and Edge.object co-occurrence frequency in all PubMed abstracts)
"filter_kg(action=remove_edges_by_attribute, edge_attribute=ngd, direction=above, threshold=0.85, remove_connected_nodes=t, qnode_key=n01)",  # remove all edges with normalized google distance above 0.85 as well as the connected protein
"return(message=true, store=false)"  # return the message to the ARS
]
```

## ARAX_messenger
### create_envelope()
The `create_envelope` command creates a basic empty Response object with basic boilerplate metadata
                such as reasoner_id, schema_version, etc. filled in. This DSL command takes no arguments. This command is not explicitly
                necessary, as it is called implicitly when needed. e.g. If a DSL program begins with add_qnode(), the
                create_envelope() will be executed automatically if there is not yet a ARAXResponse. If there is already ARAXResponse in memory,
                then this command will destroy the previous one (in memory) and begin a new envelope.

#### parameters:

### expand(kp=DTD)
This command uses ARAX's in-house drug-treats-disease (DTD) database (built from GraphSage model) to expand a query graph; it returns edges between nodes with an DTD probability above a certain threshold. The default threshold is currently set to 0.8. If you set this threshold below 0.8, you should also set DTD_slow_mode=True otherwise a warninig will occur. This is because the current DTD database only stores the pre-calcualted DTD probability above 0.8. Therefore, if an user set threshold below 0.8, it will automatically switch to call DTD model to do a real-time calculation and this will be quite time-consuming.

## ARAX_overlay
### overlay(action=add_node_pmids)

`add_node_pmids` adds PubMed PMID's as node attributes to each node in the knowledge graph.
This information is obtained from mapping node identifiers to MeSH terms and obtaining which PubMed articles have this MeSH term
either labeling in the metadata or has the MeSH term occurring in the abstract of the article.

This can be applied to an arbitrary knowledge graph as possible edge types are computed dynamically (i.e. not just those created/recognized by the ARA Expander team).
                    

#### parameters: 

* ##### max_num

    - The maximum number of values to return. Enter 'all' to return everything

    - Acceptable input types: int or string.

    - This is not a required parameter and may be omitted.

    - `all`, `5`, and `50` are examples of valid inputs.

    - If not specified the default input will be 100. 

### overlay(action=fisher_exact_test)

`fisher_exact_test` computes the Fisher's Exact Test p-values of the connection between a list of given nodes with specified query id (subject_qnode_key eg. 'n01') to their adjacent nodes with specified query id (e.g. object_qnode_key 'n02') in the message knowledge graph. 
This information is then added as an edge attribute to a virtual edge which is then added to the query graph and knowledge graph.
It can also allow you to filter out the user-defined insignificance of connections based on a specified p-value cutoff or return the top n smallest p-value of connections and only add their corresponding virtual edges to the knowledge graph.

This can be applied to an arbitrary knowledge graph as possible edge types are computed dynamically (i.e. not just those created/recognized by the ARA Expander team).

Use cases include:

* Given an input list (or a single) bioentities with specified query id in message KG, find connected bioentities  that are most "representative" of the input list of bioentities
* Find biological pathways that are enriched for an input list of proteins (specified with a query id)
* Make long query graph expansions in a targeted fashion to reduce the combinatorial explosion experienced with long query graphs 

This p-value is calculated from fisher's exact test based on the contingency table with following format:

|||||
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|                                  | in query node list | not in query node list | row total |
| connect to certain adjacent node |         a          |           b            |   a+b     |
| not connect to adjacent node     |         c          |           d            |   c+d     |
|         column total             |        a+c         |          b+d           |  a+b+c+d  |

The p-value is calculated by applying fisher_exact method of scipy.stats module in scipy package to the contingency table.
The code is as follows:

```
_, pvalue = stats.fisher_exact([[a, b], [c, d]])
```

### overlay(action=predict_drug_treats_disease)

`predict_drug_treats_disease` utilizes a machine learning model (trained on KP ARAX/KG1) to assign a probability that a given drug/chemical_substance treats a disease/phenotypic feature.
For more information about how this model was trained and how it performs, please see [this publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/765305).
The drug-disease treatment prediction probability is included as an edge attribute (with the attribute name `probability_treats`).
You have the choice of applying this to all appropriate edges in the knowledge graph, or only between specified subject/object qnode id's (make sure one is a chemical_substance, and the other is a disease or phenotypic_feature). 
If the later, virtual edges are added with the relation specified by `virtual_edge_type` and the type `probably_treats`.
Use cases include:

* Overlay drug the probability of any drug in your knowledge graph treating any disease via `overlay(action=predict_drug_treats_disease)`
* For specific drugs and diseases/phenotypes in your graph, add the probability that the drug treats them with something like `overlay(action=predict_drug_treats_disease, subject_qnode_key=n02, object_qnode_key=n00, virtual_relation_label=P1)`
* Subsequently remove low-probability treating drugs with `overlay(action=predict_drug_treats_disease)` followed by `filter_kg(action=remove_edges_by_attribute, edge_attribute=probability_treats, direction=below, threshold=.6, remove_connected_nodes=t, qnode_key=n02)`

### overlay(action=overlay_clinical_info)

`overlay_clinical_info` overlay edges with information obtained from the knowledge provider (KP) Columbia Open Health Data (COHD).
This KP has a number of different functionalities, such as `paired_concept_frequency`, `observed_expected_ratio`, etc. which are mutually exclusive DSL parameters.
All information is derived from a 5 year hierarchical dataset: Counts for each concept include patients from descendant concepts. 
This includes clinical data from 2013-2017 and includes 1,731,858 different patients.
This information is then included as an edge attribute.
You have the choice of applying this to all edges in the knowledge graph, or only between specified subject/object qnode id's. If the later, virtual edges are added with the relation specified by `virtual_relation_label`.
These virtual edges have the following types:

* `paired_concept_frequency` has the virtual edge type `has_paired_concept_frequency_with`
* `observed_expected_ratio` has the virtual edge type `has_observed_expected_ratio_with`
* `chi_square` has the virtual edge type `has_chi_square_with`

Note that this DSL command has quite a bit of functionality, so a brief description of the DSL parameters is given here:

* `paired_concept_frequency`: If set to `true`, retrieves observed clinical frequencies of a pair of concepts indicated by edge subject and object nodes and adds these values as edge attributes.
* `observed_expected_ratio`: If set to `true`, returns the natural logarithm of the ratio between the observed count and expected count of edge subject and object nodes. Expected count is calculated from the single concept frequencies and assuming independence between the concepts. This information is added as an edge attribute.
* `chi_square`: If set to `true`, returns the chi-square statistic and p-value between pairs of concepts indicated by edge subject/object nodes and adds these values as edge attributes. The expected frequencies for the chi-square analysis are calculated based on the single concept frequencies and assuming independence between concepts. P-value is calculated with 1 DOF.
* `virtual_edge_type`: Overlays the requested information on virtual edges (ones that don't exist in the query graph).

This can be applied to an arbitrary knowledge graph as possible edge types are computed dynamically (i.e. not just those created/recognized by the ARA Expander team).

This is used for purposes such as "find me all drugs (`start_node_key`) that have many proteins (`intermediate_node_key`) in common with this disease (`end_node_key`)."
This can be used for downstream filtering to concentrate on relevant bioentities.

Edge attributes are a list of additional attributes for an edge.
This action interacts particularly well with `overlay()` as `overlay()` frequently adds additional edge attributes.
there are two heuristic options: `n` for removing all but the 50 best results, `std`/`std_dev` for removing all but 
the best results more than 1 standard deviation from the mean, or `percentile` to remove all but the best 
5% of results. (if not supplied this defaults to `n`)
Use cases include:

* removing all edges with normalized google distance scores but the top 50 `edge_attribute=ngd, type=n` (i.e. remove edges that aren't represented well in the literature)
* removing all edges that Jaccard index less than 1 standard deviation above the mean. `edge_attribute=jaccard_index, type=std` (i.e. all edges that have less than 20% of intermediate nodes in common)
* etc. etc.
                
You have the option (this defaults to false) to either remove all connected nodes to such edges (via `remove_connected_nodes=t`), or
else, only remove a single subject/object node based on a query node id (via `remove_connected_nodes=t, qnode_key=<a query node id.>`

## ARAX_resultify
### resultify()
 Creates a list of results from the input query graph (QG) based on the the
information contained in the message knowledge graph (KG). Every subgraph
through the KG that satisfies the GQ is returned. Such use cases include:
- `resultify()` Returns all subgraphs in the knowledge graph that satisfy the
  query graph
- `resultiy(ignore_edge_direction=false)` This mode checks edge directions in
the QG to ensure that matching an edge in the KG to an edge in the QG is only
allowed if the two edges point in the same direction. The default is to not
check edge direction. For example, you may want to include results that include
relationships like `(protein)-[involved_in]->(pathway)` even though the
underlying KG only contains directional edges of the form
`(protein)<-[involved_in]-(pathway)`.  Note that this command will successfully
execute given an arbitrary query graph and knowledge graph provided by the
automated reasoning system, not just ones generated by Team ARA Expander.

#### parameters:
