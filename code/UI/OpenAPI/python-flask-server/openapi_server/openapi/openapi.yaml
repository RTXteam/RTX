            is greater than, and is less than, respectively. The 'matches' operator
            indicates that the value is a regular expression to be evaluated. If value
            is a list type, then at least one evaluation must be true (equivalent
            to OR). This means that the == operator with a list acts like a SQL 'IN'
            clause. If the value of the compared attribute is a list, then comparisons
            are performed between each of the constraint values and each of the attribute
            values, and any one true evaluation counts as an overall true (e.g., [1,2,3]
            == [6,7,2] is true). The == operator is therefore a broad interpretation
            of inclusion. The '===' operator requires that the constraint value and
            the attribute value be the same data type, length, content, and order
            (e.g. only [1,2,3] === [1,2,3]). The 'not' property negates the operator
            such that not and == means 'not equal to' (or 'not in' for a list), and
            not > means <=, and not < means >=, not matches means does not match,
            and not === means the match between the constraint and attribute values
            are not exact. The '==' operator SHOULD NOT be used in a manner that describes
            an "is a" subclass relationship for the parent QNode.

            must be true (equivalent to OR) unless the '===' operator is used. If
            'value' is of data type 'object', the keys of the object MAY be treated
            as a list. A 'list' data type paired with the '>' or '<' operators will
            encode extraneous comparisons, but this is permitted as it is in SQL and
            other languages.
