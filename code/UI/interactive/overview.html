<H1>Summary</H1>
<P>The <b>ARAX Expander team</b> presents a pilot Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) for evaluation by NCATS. The pilot user interface (UI) consists of two parts:<BR>
  <ol>
    <li> A full <b>web services interface</b> supporting the 0.9.3 Translator Standard Reasoner API</li>
    <li> A light Javascript-based <b>GUI</b> to make testing and visualization of results easier. The GUI is simply a thin client for the documented back end.</li>
  </ol>
  All functionality is easily available from any remote tool that uses the API.</P>

<H1>Web Services Interface</H1>
<P>The web services interface expects and returns a JSON object as defined by the OpenAPI (Swagger) based Translator Standard Reasoner API definition. Both the API framework code, Python classes, and the <a target="_blank" href="api/rtx/v1/ui/">documentation for this interface</a> are autogenerated using OpenAPI tools and can be tested interactively.</P>

<H1>Interactive Interface</H1>
<P>The <a target="_blank" href="index.html">interactive interface is a simple Javascript-enhanced web page</a> with input boxes to define queries and a results section. A few example questions are provided on the page to simplify testing.</P>

<P>There are four different ways to present queries to ARAX:<BR>
  <ol>
    <li> The original RTX <b>canned-question</b> mechanism whereby an English language question is parsed and matched to one of the template questions and then answered if possible</li>
    <li> A <b>query graph-based</b> mechanism by which an interactive tool helps the user build a query graph, which is sent to the server for answering</li>
    <li> A JSON <b>query_graph</b> snippet can be pasted into a text window. The actual "query_graph": tag should NOT be included in the paste, but rather just: { "nodes": [...], "edges": [...] }</li>
    <li> A powerful domain specific language (DSL) mechanism called <b>ARAXi</b> that allows power users direct access to all ARAX modular components individually or in series to create new or operate on existing Translator Messages</li>
  </ol>
  Response Messages are stored on the server and can be easily recalled via their URI.</P>
